	abstract = {Due to excellent power and energy density, low self-discharge and long life, lithium-ion battery plays an important role in many fields. Directed against the complexity of above noises and the strong sensitivity of the common Kalman filter algorithm to noises, the state of charge estimation of lithium-ion battery based on extended Kalman filter algorithm is investigated in this paper. Based on the second-order resistor-capacitance equivalent circuit model, the battery model parameters are identified using the MATLAB/Simulink software. A battery parameter test platform is built to test the charge-discharge efficiency, open-circuit voltage and state of charge relationship curve, internal resistance and capacitance of the individual battery are tested. The simulation and experimental results of terminal voltage for lithium-ion battery is compared to verify the effectiveness of this method. In addition, the general applicability of state of charge estimation algorithm for the battery pack is explored. The ampere-hour integral method combined with the battery modeling is used to estimate the state of charge of lithium-ion battery. The comparison of extended Kalman filter algorithm between experimental results and simulation estimated results is obtained to verify the accuracy. The extended Kalman filter algorithm proposed in this study not only establishes the theoretical basis for the condition monitoring but also provides the safe guarantee for the engineering application of lithium-ion battery.},

@article{Xinyu2025,
	abstract = {With the transformation of the global energy landscape, lithium-ion batteries have become an important component in the field of new energy storage. Accurate assessment of battery status plays a crucial role in efficiently utilizing electrical energy and extending the battery's service life. The key parameters of battery status include charging state (SOC) and power state (SOP). This paper constructs an improved 2RC-PNGV battery equivalent circuit model and introduces an innovative method to enhance the dynamics of particle swarm optimization. At the same time, an adaptive H infinity (â) filtering algorithm based on Sage-Husa and a temperature-constrained SOP estimation method for lithium-ion batteries is designed. Among them, the real-time dynamic particle swarm optimization algorithm adjusts the forgetting factor in each iteration; the adaptive Hâ filtering algorithm based on Sage-Husa improves the accuracy of SOC estimation by adapting the noise covariance matrix. Moreover, the multi-parameter constrained state estimation method for lithium-ion batteries can effectively track the changes in state quantities with different durations and instantaneous values. The improved forgetting factor least squares method has an error of fewer than 0.02 volts in the voltage simulation test, with high accuracy. The adaptive Hâ filtering algorithm based on Sage-Husa achieves higher estimation accuracy in three complex operating scenarios, ensuring that the state quantity estimation error remains below 2%. The maximum estimation error of the multi-parameter constrained state quantity estimation method is less than 84.00 watts. These research results provide a solid theoretical foundation for ensuring the safety and efficient operation of batteries.},

Accurate SoC estimations can meaningfully enhance a battery's operational longevity, fortify safety standards, and enrich user experience. This paper presents an improved open circuit voltage (OCV)-based partnership for a new generation of vehicle (PNGV) model, specifically tailored for estimating the SoC of LiFePO4 blade batteries. These batteries are distinctively characterized by their advantages in safety, energy density, and thermal management. The proposed model uniquely integrates the SoC-dependent property of the battery's internal resistance, facilitating a marked improvement in estimation accuracy over existing PNGV models. Experimental results underscore the capability and effectiveness of the proposed model in estimating real-time discharging curves, achieving a remarkably low relative error rate of 0.85%.},
